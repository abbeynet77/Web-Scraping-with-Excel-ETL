According to Wikipedia, the World Happiness Report is a publication that contains articles and rankings of national happiness, based on respondent ratings of their own lives, which the report also correlates with various (quality of) life factors.

The report is a publication of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, a global initiative of the United Nations.

The report primarily uses data from the Gallup World Poll. Each annual report is available to the public to download on the World Happiness Report website.

The Editors of the 2020 report are John F. Helliwell, Richard Layard, Jeffrey D. Sachs, and Jan-Emmanuel De Neve. Associate Editors are Lara Aknin, Shun Wang, and Haifang Huang.
